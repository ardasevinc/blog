# It's Not Hard To Build Usable Websites

It takes more effort to create unusable websites. In fact, take a look at this [motherfucking website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).

See? This website may look ugly but it's usable. 

It takes *7 CSS declarations* to make it better. We might as well just call it [better motherfucking website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) at this point.

Ah yes, "I love my websites like I love my newspaper job boards" Age. I hope no one has to see or visit this page again.

# Why Do I Want To Build Better Websites

I grew up with windows xp, vista and 7. I've come to dislike windows but that's a story for another time. What I mean is I've used lots of shitty interfaces. I don't wish that for anyone. 

My intentions are to make your experience on the web *better*.

I want to make your life on the web easier.

It helps everyone. 

After all,

## The Web Is For Everyone.

The web has come a long way from sharing documents with fellow academics to creating the web with frens. It is a living and evolving construct, connecting all of us. 

We can make it better. More accessible, more secure and empowering for all.

See [Mozillaâ€™s vision for the evolution of the Web] )https://webvision.mozilla.org/full/) for more.

Let's make it better.

Thank you for reading.
